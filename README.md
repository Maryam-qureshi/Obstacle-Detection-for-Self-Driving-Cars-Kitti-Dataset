# üöó SafeDrive: AI-Powered Obstacle Detection System

SafeDrive is an AI-powered obstacle detection system designed to enhance road safety by providing real-time alerts about potential hazards. It utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to detect obstacles, pedestrians, and other vehicles, helping drivers make quick and informed decisions.

## üìå Introduction

Every year, a significant number of road accidents occur due to human error, limited visibility, and delayed driver reactions. SafeDrive aims to address these challenges by acting as an intelligent co-pilot for drivers. By integrating real-time detection and alert systems into vehicles, SafeDrive seeks to:

- Reduce accidents
- Improve driver awareness
- Enhance overall traffic safety

The motivation behind the project stems from the need to reduce road fatalities and improve decision-making during challenging driving conditions such as fog, rain, or night-time travel.
